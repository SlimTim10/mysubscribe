# MySubscribe

## Description

A web app that allows users to subscribe to any web page and receive an alert when it has changed.

Users can create accounts or use their Google account to sign up. They can then enter URLs of pages that they wish to subscribe to. Subscribing to a page means that the web app will check for changes periodically (at least once every 24 hours) and notify the user in their account and (optionally) by e-mail.
